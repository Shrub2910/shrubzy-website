# Shrubzy website

## Social media platform
The website will be a social media platform allowing the user to make posts, comment on other people's posts,
like and dislike posts, follow other users.

## What has been completed so far
- Users <br>
- Posts <br>
- Individual pages for posts <br>

## What I'm working on
- Making the website look pretty (I'm not good at art) <br>
- Allowing the editing and deletion of posts <br>
- User customisation <br>
- Either a direct message feature or the ability to tag other people in posts <b>(or both)</b>
